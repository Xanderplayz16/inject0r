## From prebuilts
Just download the latest prebuilt for your OS, then just extract it and run the executable named `inject0r`.
## From source
### Downloading
Just `git clone` it.
### Usage
First, you need Bun, the preferred JS runtime for OpenInject0r. Just download it, or if you use Nix, use `nix-shell`.

Once that's downloaded, just run `bun i` to install the dependencies, then start it with `bun start`.
